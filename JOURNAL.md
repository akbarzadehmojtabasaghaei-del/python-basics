### üóìÔ∏è Date: 2025-09-26

**‚úÖ Main Topics Today:**
- Finalizing the main project `README.md`.
- Structuring the chapter guides for `00-Introduction` and `01-Setup`.
- Deep dive into Markdown formatting for professional documentation.
- Learning the importance of separating "project-level" vs. "chapter-level" information.

**‚úçÔ∏è My Understanding & Notes:**
Today was another foundational day. I realized that a professional repository isn't just about the code, but how it's presented. I spent the entire day structuring the main entry points of my project. I moved my high-level "Blueprint" to the main `README.md`, making it the true landing page. Then, I organized the content for the first two chapters (`00-Introduction` and `01-Setup`) into their own dedicated `README.md` files. This separation makes the project structure much cleaner and more logical.

**ü§Ø Challenges & Questions:**
The biggest challenge today was surprisingly frustrating: wrestling with Markdown formatting. I struggled for a while with copy-paste issues that were breaking the layout of my files, especially the headings and code blocks. It was a good lesson in paying attention to small details and learning how to debug documentation just like I would debug code.

**üí° Discoveries & Resources Today:**
- My main discovery was the importance of **atomic commits**. Instead of making many changes at once, I learned to make one small change (like fixing a file's location), and commit it with a clear message. This makes the project history much easier to read.
- I continued to get great feedback and guidance, which helped me quickly resolve the structural issues. This collaborative process is teaching me a lot.

**üíª A Key Code Snippet I Wrote:**
No Python today. The most important "code" was perfecting the Markdown structure. This is the clean structure for a chapter guide that I finalized:
```markdown
# ‚öôÔ∏è Chapter Title

Introductory paragraph explaining the chapter's purpose.
