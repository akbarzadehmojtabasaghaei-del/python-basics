### üóìÔ∏è Date: 2025-09-25

**‚úÖ Main Topics Today:**
- Advanced GitHub Repository Management.
- Understanding Software Licenses (MIT, etc.).
- Improving `README.md` with advanced Markdown.
- The concept and practice of maintaining a learning journal.
- Preliminary research into coding conventions and copyright.

**‚úçÔ∏è My Understanding & Notes:**
Today was a "meta" day, focused less on writing Python code and more on building a professional developer presence on GitHub. I spent a significant amount of time organizing my repository's folder structure and content to make it more logical and clean.

A big highlight was learning how to properly license my code. I also dedicated a lot of time to polishing my main `README.md` file. Learning how to create clickable links in Markdown was a small detail that made the entire page feel much more interactive and professional. I realized that documenting my journey in a daily journal like this is a powerful way to track progress and solidify what I've learned.

**ü§Ø Challenges & Questions:**
The main challenge wasn't a bug in code, but rather navigating the professional standards of software development. I became very curious about the legal aspects, like copyright and licensing. I plan to dive deeper into coding conventions tomorrow to ensure I'm building good habits from the start.

**üí° Discoveries & Resources Today:**
- **Primary Research:** I became curious about licensing after seeing it on another GitHub profile. I used YouTube to get a general overview.
- **Help from AI:** I used both **Gemini** and **Qwen** to ask specific questions about different license types. I found Gemini's explanations to be particularly clear and helpful.
- **Inspiration & Mentorship:** I reviewed several public GitHub profiles from experienced developers to get inspiration for my own structure. I'm also very grateful for my friends who gave me valuable feedback today.

**üíª A Key Code Snippet I Wrote:**
Today's "code" was Markdown! I learned the syntax for creating links to my project folders, which was a great win.
```markdown
