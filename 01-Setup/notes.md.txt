## Step 1: Installing Python üêç

All code in this repository is written in **Python 3**. It is crucial to have a recent version installed and correctly configured.

-   **Action:**
    1.  Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
    2.  Download the latest stable version for your operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
-   **‚≠ê Critical Tip for Windows Users:**
    During installation, make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"**. This will allow you to run Python from your terminal easily. If you miss this, you may need to add it manually later. 
-   **Verification:**
    Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal) and run the following command:
    ```bash
    python --version
    # Or on some systems:
    python3 --version
    ```
    You should see a version number like `Python 3.10.x` or higher.

## Step 2: Installing a Code Editor: Visual Studio Code üìù

While you can write Python in any text editor, a modern code editor (or IDE) provides powerful features like syntax highlighting, code completion (IntelliSense), and debugging tools. We will be using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.

-   **Action:**
    1.  Download and install VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
-   **Essential Extensions:**
    Once VS Code is installed, you must install the official Python extension pack to unlock its full potential.
    1.  Open VS Code.
    2.  Go to the Extensions view (icon on the left sidebar, or `Ctrl+Shift+X`).
    3.  Search for **"Python Extension Pack"** published by Microsoft.
    4.  Click **Install**. This pack includes the main Python extension, Pylint for code analysis, and more.

## Step 3: Version Control with Git & GitHub SCM

This project is managed and versioned using Git, and hosted on GitHub. This is the standard practice for all modern software development.

-   **Action:**
    1.  Install Git on your system by following the guide on the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
-   **Cloning the Repository:**
    To get a local copy of this project on your machine, you'll use the `git clone` command in your terminal.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/akbarzadehmojtabasaghaei-del/python-basics.git](https://github.com/akbarzadehmojtabasaghaei-del/python-basics.git)
    ```
-   **Opening in VS Code:**
    After cloning, you can open the entire project folder in VS Code by navigating into the directory and typing:
    ```bash
    cd python-basics
    code .
    ```
    The `code .` command tells VS Code to open the current directory.

With these steps completed, your development environment is fully configured and ready for our journey into Python!
