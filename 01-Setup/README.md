# Chapter 1: Development Environment Setup

This chapter is dedicated to documenting the tools and configuration required to run the Python code in this repository.

The primary goal is to ensure that the development environment is consistent and reproducible for anyone who wishes to work with this project, including my future self on a new machine.

The detailed step-by-step guide covers the installation and setup of:
- Python 3
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and essential extensions
- Git for version control

A proper setup is the first and most critical step for a smooth development journey.
