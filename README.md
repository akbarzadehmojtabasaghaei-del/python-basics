# My Python Learning Journey 🐍

This repo is my personal logbook — a place where I document every step of my journey from an absolute beginner to (hopefully!) a confident Python developer.
No fluff. No fake expertise. Just real progress, real mistakes, and real code.

##  Why I'm Doing This
I’m 19 and teaching myself to code because I believe it’s the key to solving real problems and building a meaningful future.
This isn’t just about syntax — it’s about building skills that matter.

My goals are to:
✅ Master Python deeply — not just copy-paste.
✅ Build projects that solve actual problems (even small ones).
✅ Create a portfolio that speaks louder than any certificate.

##  Tech Stack & Mindset
Language: Python 3.11

Editor: VS Code (with Python, Pylance, and GitLens extensions)

Mindset: “Break it → Fix it → Understand it”

##  Project Structure

Each folder is a chapter in my self-taught curriculum:

00-Introduction/      → Why I started, setup notes
01-Basics/            → Variables, data types, input/output
02-Control-Flow/      → If/else, loops, logic
...
assignments/          → My solutions to exercises
sandbox/              → Temporary experiments (ignored in Git)

💡 The code in each chapter is my own implementation — often rewritten 2–3 times until it felt “right”.

## Current Focus (as of September 2025)
I’m working through functions and object-oriented programming.
My next mini-project: a command-line tool to organize files by type (e.g., move all .jpg files to an Images folder).
Once it’s ready, I’ll feature it here with a short demo.

## Let’s Connect — Feedback is Welcome!
I’m not an expert — I’m a learner.
If you spot a better way to write something, or have a tip, please open an issue or just message me. I’ll appreciate it more than you know.
