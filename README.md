# My Python Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my repository where I document my journey of learning Python from scratch. This project follows a structured course, with each folder representing a chapter of my learning.

## Goal
My goal is to master the fundamentals of Python and build a strong portfolio of projects along the way.

## Structure
- Each numbered folder (`00-Introduction`, `01-Setup`, etc.) corresponds to a chapter in my course.
- The `assignments` folder inside each chapter contains solutions to exercises.
- The `sandbox` folder is used for temporary tests and is excluded from version control.

Feel free to follow my progress!
